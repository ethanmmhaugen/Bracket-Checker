 # Assignment: Do My Brackets Match?

**Objectives:**

* Implement a templated list data structure.
* Developing tests and automated code testing using the catch2 framework.
* Implement a stack interface.


## Time Line 
You have about three weeks to complete the assignment. Start right away! **The lab TA will expect that you already have most of that week's work completed. Come with prepared questions and
be prepared to answer the TA's questions about your code.**

* Week 1: DSList class with CATCH2 tests and memory leak debugging using `valgrind/asan`. **Deliverables:** `DSList` implementation + test
* Week 2: DSStack classes + basic bracket checking function that can check one file (just OK/not OK). **Deliverables:** `DSStack` implementation + `CATCH2` tests, checker function.
* Week 3: Add detailed error messages (E.g., in what line an incorrect bracket is). Add a second vector-based implementation of DSStack. Add timing information and runtime comparison. Improve the code and the documentation comments. **Deliverables:** completed project.


## Introduction
Writing code is fun... Well, most of the time. Sometimes I mess up
brackets (i.e., `"[]", "()", "{}"`). 
I have a library of hundreds of
source code files and do not want to manually open each one up in VS Code,
so I need a program to do the checking for me.

The program should be called in the following way:

```
check_brackets <input_file>
```

It should produce the following output:

1. If no error is found: `<input_file>: OK` and return 0 (meaning the program executed successfully)
2. If an error is found: `<input_file>: Bracket mismatch detected` and return 1 (meaning there was a problem).

   Also print debugging information that is as specific as possible. For example:
     - What type of bracket is the issue.
     - The line number of the `input_file` where the issue was detected.
     - The text of the line where the issue was detected.
     - Any information that would help me to fix the issue.

## The Algorithm
Check code for balanced brackets: push `({[` on the stack and take them off when the corresponding `)`, `}`, or `)` is seen. Any error or a non-empty stack at the end of the code indicates a problem.

## The Data
 You can get some source code (e.g., from the examples in this class) and check them. Then introduce some mistakes and check again. The `data` directory contains example files.

## Implementation Requirements
Write good, well documented code!

You **cannot use STL containers for the stack.**
You need to implement two versions of the stack. 

For strings, you can use the STL class `std::string`. Reading STL strings is a 
lot easier than c-strings. See first part of the [IO example](https://github.com/mhahsler/CS2341/blob/main/Chapter1_Programming/io/fileIO_main.cpp). 


1. A stack based on your own list class implementation
2. A stack based on an array or a `std::vector`. 

Write two programs (add another executable to the `CMakeLists.txt`), one based on a list and one based on a vector/array and compare the runtime on some larger source code files. Your programs should report the runtime every time. See [the code examples in Chapter2 Algorithm Analysis](https://github.com/mhahsler/CS2341/tree/main/Chapter2_Algorithm_Analysis) for examples of how to measure runtime in C++.


## Additional Work (Bonus)
* Check all the `c-lang` source code from [llvm project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) in the directories `clang/include/` and `clang/lib/`.
* C++ also uses `\*` and `*\` and string delimiters `"` and `'` which can be checked for consistency.
* How would you check `<>` in C++ since it is used in templates, but can also be used as 
comparison operators?
* Better testing: Can you generate an long text file that randomly nested brackets to a specified depth that you can use to test your code better?
* You could use the function call stack as the "stack" in your program and implement the checker as a recursive program. 
* Could your program make a recommendation of where to place missing brackets? How would it do that.


## Answers
1. How long did the program take with each version (You will need more than the test date)?  Describe the reason for the difference in run-time (from your experiment).

   > The two programs had very similar runtimes, between .002-.003 seconds for each of them. I think the reason for them being almost identical was that I
   designed the two stack implementations extremely similarly, and used the same code to check brackets only changing which version of the stack I used.
    
2. Discuss the difference in memory usage based on your implementation. You will need to think about how the versions 
 store data.

   > In the test cases that I ran with rather limited maximum size for the stack, the memory usage was about the same for both implementations.
    However, from what I know about vectors when their capacity needs to be increased it typically just doubles, which means that at a certain
>   depth of test data, the vector implementation would allocate way more memory than necessary while the list implementation would only even implement the amout of memory necessary

3. Which version would you use in practice. Why?

   > I would use the list implementation since it runs at about the same speed, but with more precise memory usage.

4. Make sure that your stack implementation does not have memory leaks.
   Valgrind literally says "Nothing to show", not sure what else to paste in here.

5. I attempted bonus for early submission, /* and " delimiters, recommendations for missing brackets, and generating a bigger list of test data (the testGenerator class)


   ```
   Paste the output of valgrind or the AddressSanitizer to for running your tests for DSList and DSStack to show that your code is fine. 
   ```
